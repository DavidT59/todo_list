Todo List Application Documentation

Introduction

The Todo List application is a straightforward program written in C. It's designed to efficiently store user tasks, leveraging structures and linked lists for data management. Memory for each task is dynamically allocated, ensuring optimal use of resources. Tasks can be removed either by user action or automatically when they are past their due date, at which point the allocated memory is also freed \*

Folder structure:

//Important information
Main Compilation File: app.c serves as the core of the application, compiling all necessary header files. This centralization simplifies the build process.

Modular Design: The project is segmented into various files. This modular approach enhances readability, simplifies debugging, and streamlines code maintenance. Each component can be developed and tested independently, contributing to a more robust application.
